Why is it such an artificial-feeling situation to create prose simply to fill space? I suppose the primary requirement of language, which is communication, has been dropped. Perhaps it also shows that the generativity which comes naturally to any digital computer - simply run the loop more times or go deeper into recursion - is alien to human consciousness which, so the popular science meme goes, can only deal with roughly seven separate items at once without losing track. Makes me think of Chomsky's regular languages - a powerful concept and yet one deceptively far away from human experience and perhaps most human utility.
